The @HIPAA sets privacy requirements specifically for healthcare-related businesses or organizations dealing with healthcare records of individuals. Under the [Privacy Rule](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-regulations/index.html), these entities cannot disclose health information without the owner's explicit consent. There are [several exceptions](https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/publications/topic/hipaa.html#three) where authorization is not needed, such as in law enforcement and court cases, as well as any "essential government functions," for instance in preventing a pandemic. Employee information tracked as part of official employment records also are not covered, even if the employer is a covered healthcare entity.

HIPAA also does not cover non-healthcare related entities, for instance health information entered into a mobile app on your phone or given to a DNA testing company.

@SOAPBOX In short, HIPAA usually does not apply to Federal agencies for most practical purposes.
